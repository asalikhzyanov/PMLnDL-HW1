# Assignment #1: Simulated Annealing & Sampling. Repository

## Instructions (user manual)
* Clone the repository
* To run a solution for the first task, jupyter server with all needed dependencies installed is needed or google colab can be used.
* To run second task solution open terminal and run the following:
  
  ```cd path/to/PMLnDL-HW1/task2 ``` 

  ```python3 salesman.py``` 

  Alternatively, this solution could be run in any IDE with Python >= 3.6 installed (like PyCharm).

## Just to notice
task2 folder contains visualization of simulated annealing optimization process (SimaulatedAnnealing.gif) for slow cooling. 
You can get a visualization related to any annealing rate by passing it as a parameter to `simulated_annealing()` method: at the 
end of execution a gif file should be inside task2 folder.
